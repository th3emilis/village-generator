Build villages anywhere in your world with the run of a single command. Village Generator adds various functions to the game to help you design your own village from scratch quickly and easily. Now, go bring more life into your superflat worlds!

## Features

### Individual structures
Build your own village, structure by structure.

## Usage

In the chat screen, type `/function vg/help` to get a list of several available functions. Every subfolder includes a similar help function, such as `/function vg/taiga/help`.

Once you have found the structure you want to generate, make sure you are positioned at the location where you want it to be placed. When selecting a location, keep in mind that structures generate diagonally to the right in the cardinal direction your character is facing. For example, if you are facing east, the structure will generate toward positive `X` and `Y` coordinate values.

Here are a few functions you can try before digging into all the available options:
- `/function vg/instant_village/old/taiga`: *Generate a prebuilt old-type taiga village*
- `/function vg/instant_village/desert_1`: *Generate a prebuilt desert village*
- `/function vg/instant_village/plains_2`: *Generate a prebuilt plains village*
- `/function vg/savanna/houses/small_house_1`: *Generate a savanna small house*
- `/function vg/populate`: *Summon villagers, cats, and an iron golem for your village*

### Recommended settings
In order to ensure that instant villages generate correctly, **it is recommended that you set your simulation distance to at least 6 chunks**. Instant villages are large structures and attempting to generate them in unloaded chunks may cause some individual structures of the village to fail to generate.

### Using on mobile
Many functions use long names that can get tedious to type on a mobile device after a while. For a better experience, you can use the add-on alongside [Advanchat](https://github.com/th3emilis/advanchat/releases/latest), which allows you to autocomplete commands and access previously run commands easily.
